        <p>My favorite hobby is gardening. I like gardening very much. I love to see the flowers blooming, beans hanging. It is so much fun to water the plants! If we are growing a plant with all our care then we will be very happy when the flower blooms. It is like magic when from a tiny flower a chilly comes hanging. It is also fun to give fertilizer to the plant and make it grow. If I am feeling bored, it is fun to take care of my plants. I like this hobby more than others. It is beautiful to see green all around and sometimes the different colours of the flowers. It seems fun to me. </p>
        <p>I am very sad when my plant is affected with diseases. But no problem, I and the plant will fight it. There are some sad times when the plant will die,but it leaves a small plant before it dies. It is very fun to sow the seeds and wacth it grow. It is fun when we arrange our garden in various ways and make it beautiful. It makes me very happy when I get to eat vegetables planted by me at home. </p>
